            Waterproof Mobiles Are Really Waterproof? What’s The Truth Behind This Myth?
          </p>

            The magial thing about smartphones in this era is that they can be wet in the dust, rain, capture photos inside the water or swim-pool and we don’t need to think about phone damage. Water proof device but we understand these benefits. But how true is what we understand? The truth is,  these devices are not water proof – they are water resistant! And that’s exactly what makes the difference, which is what we need to know. <br> <br>

            Of course not only smartphones but also wearable gadgets like smart watches, fitness bands etc. are improving our mobility and quality of daily life. So along with smartphones, all these devices are gaining new capabilities every day.

The biggest problem with the devices that are always involved in our lives is the touch of water. So nowadays phone manufacturers are more interested in making water proof devices. Phone companies always claim that, their phones are water proof. But this word is never true. So if you are not careful about your device, you may have to pay a lot of money.

Friends, in today’s article I will discuss the difference between water proof and water-resistant. I will discuss further, if your device is water-resistant, then what precautions do you need to take? And as a bonus there will be many more important information related to this. So let’s get started.
<br> <br>
Water proof vs. water resistant <br> <br>

Water proof device means that no water can enter the device, whereas water resistant device means that water will enter the device a lot of the time but even then it will be protected to some level. No device manufacturing company is able to make water proof devices, their devices are water resistant. Although it is a subtle matter, it is a serious difference. <br> <br>

Yes, your phone may have the ability to wet in rainwater, but you can’t go diving into the deep sea with it. Yes, your smartwatch may be able to show you underwater time, but you can’t press any of its buttons under the water — because pressing a button will open its protective layer and allow water to enter.

So when there is no such thing as a water proof device, discussing it will not be of any use to you. So let’s talk about water resistant. These are divided into two standards according to the device to determine how water resistant or how long a device can withstand. The standards are ATM and another IP.<br> <br>The ATM standard is used for wearable devices<br> <br>
ATM means the atmosphere here. One type of atmospheric pressure exists around you when you are above sea level and another type of atmospheric pressure exists around you when you are at a depth of 10 meters of water. The upper pressure is taken as 1 atm and the underwater pressure of 10 m is taken as 2 atm. In this way, a separate ATM is set up for every 10 meters of underwater depth.<br> <br>
The water resistance of smart watches and your fitness bands is usually expressed by ATMs. If your device is rated by Water Resistant 5 ATMs, you can go for deep sea diving comfortably with it, you can swim comfortably in your swimming pool.

But to be honest, there is no standard test for wearable devices. But even then, as a user, if your device is 5 ATMs, you have no reason to worry. But your device is of ATM standard so it is a water resistant device — so depending on the quality of its ATM you can determine how deep you can go in the water. Another problem is that you can’t press a button while you’re in the water.

<br> <br>IP rating is used for the phone<br> <br>

While there is no standard test for wearable devices, there is a water resistant standard test for smartphones. This test has the rule ” of the International Electro Technical Commission  (International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)” . And this is the standard test method of International Protection (International Protection) or IP (IP). IP rating is usually a two-digit code.

For example, the IP rating of the Samsung Galaxy S8 Edge is IP68. The first of these two digits indicates dust protection. Where 6 is the highest rating (it has been achieved in most of today’s smartphones). And the second digit indicates water protection, where 9 is the highest rating (but most phones have a 7.8 rating). Let us know about the IP rating of water protection from the list below.

1:  There will be no harm in boiling water.
2:  There will be no harm in boiling water and no harm even if it falls 15 degrees vertically.
3: There  is no harm in spraying water, there is no harm in falling 60 degrees vertically.
4: There is  no harm in washing the phone with water from any side.
There is  no harm in throwing water with a water jet of 5: 6.3 mm nozzle.
6: There is  no harm in throwing water with a water jet of 12.5 mm nozzle.
7:  1 meter deep water immersed for a maximum of 30 minutes will not cause any damage.
8:  immersion in water deeper than 1 meter for a maximum of 30 minutes will not cause any damage.
9: There is  no harm in spraying water with higher temperature and higher pressure.
Hopefully by now you have a very good idea about the different IP ratings. But there is a problem here too – your device is Water Protection IP Rating 8 but that does not mean that it is tested IP Rating 6 or IP Rating 7! And this is why some devices have multiple IP ratings. For example, Sony Xperia Z5 has both IP rating IP65 and IP rating IP68.

But you don’t have to worry so much, I was just talking about technical matters. If any device passes the IP rating of 5, 6, 7, and 8, respectively, that device will automatically pass the first four steps as well. Such as water splashes, water sprays, and water splashes. So what is the first thing you need to consider before buying a water resistant phone? The first thing to look at is the second digit of IP ratings. The higher the number, the higher the protection.

Limitations of water proof devices
The truth is that by now you know very well that “water proof” is actually “water resistant”. So let’s learn about some of the limitations of water proof technology in terms of conditions. So that you can easily determine exactly what you need to be careful about.

Seals and Buttons – If your phone has a lid on the SIM slot or memory slot, turn it off. Because if these lids are open, water can enter inside. If you have a button on your device, refrain from pressing it under water. Pressing the button can open the mouth of the protection layer and allow water to enter your phone. Yes, some phone companies allow you to press a button on your phone. But before you press the button, it’s best to check if your company allows it.

Just in fresh water – are you thinking of taking your phone deeper into the ocean? Yes! But should you do it? No, not at all! Friends see every water resistant IP test but only done with fresh water. Not in seawater. Salt dissolved in seawater can cause extreme damage to your phone. So, if you have a water proof phone, it is better to keep it away from sea water. If the phone accidentally goes into sea water, it should be washed immediately with clean water.

Not in liquids other than water – every IP test not only guarantees protection against water, but also against coffee, tea, cold drinks, oil, etc. So even if by mistake any liquid other than water spills on your phone, immediately turn off the power of the phone, open the battery if possible and wipe the phone well and wash it with clean water and turn on the power again.

Water proof. But It’s not a feature!
Friends, one thing to know very well is that the phone being water proof means it is a protection against water but it is not a feature. You may have seen in the advertisement of a water proof phone that everyone is going under water and taking pictures together. But how much is it really possible? Underwater phone touch screens will never work well. As a result, you can’t understand where you are touching the phone taking pictures has become a long way off.

Being phone water proof is just a measure of protection, it’s not a new feature. So every time the phone gets wet, turn off the phone, remove the battery if possible, wipe the phone with a dry cloth, and turn on the phone.
